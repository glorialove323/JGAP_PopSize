/**
 * Rosenbrock's valley is a classic optimization problem, 
 * also known as Banana function. 
 * The global optimum is inside a long, narrow, parabolic shaped flat valley. 
 * To find the valley is trivial, 
 * however convergence to the global optimum is difficult and hence this problem 
 * has been repeatedly used in assess the performance of optimization algorithms.
 * function definition
 * f2(x)=sum(100Â·(x(i+1)-x(i)^2)^2+(1-x(i))^2), i=1:n-1;
 * -2.048<=x(i)<=2.048.
 * global minimum
 * f(x)=0; x(i)=1, i=1:n.
